A text file stores data in the form of alphabets, digits and other special symbols by storing their ASCII values and are in a  human-readable format. for example, any file with a .txt, .c,etc extension. whereas binary file contains a sequence or a collection of bytes which are not in a human-readable format. text files follow some simple rules whereas binary files do not. both are a stream of bytes. in binary files, they have no concept of \"records\" neither repeating fix-length data records nor a stream of data that follows agreed-upon rules/restrictions for data ranges/ values which then permit us to implement variable-sided records. Binary files are chock full of bytes that have values ranging from 0...255"
